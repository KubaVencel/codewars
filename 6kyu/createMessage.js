/*

"Stringing"+"Me"+"Along"

Description:

Implement a function that receives a string, and lets you extend it with repeated calls. When no argument is passed you should return a string consisting of space-separated words you've received earlier.

Note: There will always be at least 1 string; all inputs will be non-empty.

For example:

createMessage("Hello")("World!")("how")("are")("you?")() === "Hello World! how are you?"

Tip (helpful, but not necessary): Try using classes!

Good luck and happy coding!

*/

function createMessage(str) {
  return function(next){
    if( next === undefined) {return str};
    return createMessage(str + " " + next);
  }
}
