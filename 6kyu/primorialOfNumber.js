Primorial Of a Number 

Description:
Definition (Primorial Of a Number)

Is similar to factorial of a number, In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It's denoted with P# and it is the product of the first n prime numbers.
Task

Given a number N , calculate its primorial. !alt !alt
Notes

    Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0) .

Input >> Output Examples:

1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)

Explanation:

Since the passed number is (3) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 = 30 .
Mathematically written as , P3# = 30 .

2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)

Explanation:

Since the passed number is (5) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying  2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310 .
Mathematically written as , P5# = 2310 .

3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)

Explanation:

Since the passed number is (6) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying  2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030 .
Mathematically written as , P6# = 30030 .
